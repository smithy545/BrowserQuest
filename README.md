BrowserQuest-Rework
============

This is a rework of the original mozilla/BrowserQuest repository using socket.io for web sockets instead of using their previous library for websockets. I did this because the original relied on some repositories that no longer worked or exist.

This version works as-is, all you need to do is download the repo, run "npm install", start the server with node, then connect. You might run into bugs resulting from things I may have missed in the transition but in my testing it seems to work pretty well.
