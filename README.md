BrowserQuest
============

This is a rework of the original mozilla/BrowserQuest repository using socket.io for web sockets
instead of using their previous library for websockets. I did this because the original relied on
some repositories that no longer worked or exist. You might run into bugs due to the transition
but in my testing it seems to work pretty well.
